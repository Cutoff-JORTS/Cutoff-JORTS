 Not much going on here, I expect at first it will be a couple of personal learning projects amounting to a child's homework. That being said, I'm 100% self-taught to date.
 Spent 9years working in retail & private banking, just working for a check and spending half of my time in the office resolving local "tech" issues anyway.
 As of June 5 2023, began self-instruction on Linux server-oriented distros
 As of June 12, home lab assembled & start of uptime tracking
